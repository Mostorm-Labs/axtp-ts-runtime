# AXTP Generated Versioning

Runtime repositories track three separate version concepts:

- AXTP Spec Version comes from the AXTP main repository tag, such as `spec/v0.3.0`.
- Runtime Version comes from this runtime repository, such as `v0.3.0.1`.
- Generated Artifact Version comes from `generated/axtp_generated_manifest.json` and generated language constants.

AXTP Spec tags use `spec/vX.Y.Z`. Runtime release tags use `vX.Y.Z.R`, where `R` is a runtime/tool revision scoped to the locked spec version.
Runtime revision releases may move independently while staying on the same locked AXTP
Spec patch.

When a root `VERSION` file is present, it is the canonical runtime release
version used by generated metadata and GitHub Releases. `package.json` may use
an npm-compatible projection such as `0.3.0-runtime.1`.

## Runtime Revision Workflow

For runtime-only changes that do not change `AXTP_SPEC.lock.yaml`, use
`.github/workflows/release-runtime-revision.yml` or the local skill at
`devtools/skills/70-release-runtime-revision/SKILL.md`. The workflow runs
`devtools/scripts/prepare-runtime-revision.sh`, increments only `R`,
regenerates version metadata, and opens a PR. After that PR merges,
`auto-release-on-merge.yml` creates tag `vX.Y.Z.R`.

## Generated Manifest

Every generator run writes:

```text
generated/axtp_generated_manifest.json
```

The manifest records:

- `axtpSpec` from `AXTP_SPEC.lock.yaml`
- `generator` from `devtools/generators/package.json` and the current repository commit
- `runtime` from the runtime version source and current repository commit
- `inputs.registryHash`, `inputs.schemasHash`, and `inputs.conformanceHash`

Missing `schemas` or `conformance` directories are recorded as `null`; the
generator does not invent hashes for missing inputs.

## Checks

Use:

```bash
devtools/scripts/check-generated-version.sh
devtools/scripts/check-runtime-release.sh 0.3.0.1
```

`check-generated-version.sh` validates lock, manifest, runtime version, and
language constants. `check-runtime-release.sh` adds runtime tag validation and
rejects releases based on `tag: unreleased`.
